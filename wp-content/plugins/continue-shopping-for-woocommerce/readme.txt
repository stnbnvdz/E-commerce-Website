Easily change the 'Continue Shopping' link when redirected to the Cart after adding a Product.

== Description ==
When a customer is redirected to the Cart page after the addition of a product, there is a 'Continue Shopping' button. As default, this button takes the customer back to your website Home Page.

This can be very annoying for customers who want a smooth flowing shopping process.

This can now be solved with the click of a button. This plugin adds a list of options into the WooCommerce Settings page that allows you to easily alter where this button will take your customers.

You can choose between the preset locations below:
 <blockquote>
 - Homepage<br />
 - Shop<br />
 - Most recently visited Product<br />
 - Most recently visited Category
 </blockquote>

Finally there is a fifth option of your own custom link. This can be used to allow you to push customers back to a custom Landing page, or your best selling product.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to WooCommerce -> Settings -> Products -> Continue Shopping to change where the button will take you.
